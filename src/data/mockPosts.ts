    content: "I (28M) was flying home for the holidays and had booked an aisle seat in advance. A family with two young kids approached me asking if I could move to a middle seat so they could sit together. I politely declined because I specifically chose and paid extra for the aisle seat due to my long legs. The mother became very upset and said I was being selfish. Other passengers started staring and I felt awkward. AITA?",

She came home and was furious, saying she was saving it for today. I told her food shouldn't sit in the fridge that long anyway and I was doing her a favor by preventing food poisoning. She's demanding I pay her back $15. AITA?",

She's also made several comments about my fianc√© being 'not good enough' for me. I decided not to invite her to my wedding to avoid drama. My parents are furious and say I'm tearing the family apart. AITA?",

I finally went over and politely told them their dog was disturbing the peace and asked if they could do something about it. They got defensive and said 'dogs bark, deal with it.' I told them their dog was poorly trained and annoying. Now they're giving me dirty looks. AITA?",

I ordered the cheapest salad ($28) while she got a $75 steak and $15 cocktails. When the bill came, she suggested we split it evenly. I said I'd only pay for what I ordered plus tip. She got embarrassed and said I was being cheap in front of our server. AITA?",
